    "String representations of molecules are powerful tools to talk to computers about molecules as they can be used to generate graphs from which all relevant structural information can be generated. Known string representations of molecules are SMILES, SELFIES, INCHI and many more. From a programmers and force field developers perspective they come with several drawbacks. Some of them are hardly human readable whereas others are restricted to fixed alphabets like the periodic table. Moreover, there are not always tools that generate graphs from the strings. In general most of those languages come with a combination of syntax and semantics. The latter often has a limiting effect and reduces flexibility, although this is often desired in coarse grained molecular models and engineering applications. Therfore we developed moleculegraph that only focusses on providing basic semantics to describe molecules but is agnostic against syntax. This also makes sense from a programmer's point of view, as it is much easier to teach computers rules than meaning. Hence, the graph representation in string form can be filled with any information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore writing code about is very hard when you need to deal with molecules. The mail goal of moleculegraph is allowing writing code about molecules without the need to deal with them. Based on an input string a graph is generated that seves as a mapping tool for information. Any information about atoms (or beads or knots or whatever you wanna call them) stored in a dictionary (or library or whatever you wanna call it) can thus be transported to the relevant locations or substructures in the molecule and used further. For advanced use moleculegraph is compatible with networkx via the bond list. Furthermore example code is provided to generate a moleculegraph object from rdkit (and pubchem API).\n",
    "\n",
    "Moleculegraph is in use in various applications. These extend over various scales. Starting from energy matching to quantum mechanics energy surfaces via the setup of molecular simulations and the optimisation of force fields through equations of state and group contribution theories. In all examples moleculegraph performs molecule-specific operations in the background and has accelerated code development by allowing programmers to focus on the essentials. \n",
